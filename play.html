 <h2>ABOUT US </h2>
 <p>Funny Bunny kids aims to encourage a child to wonder, to think, to feel and to imagine.

The program shows two warm, caring people taking the time to be with one child. They address the child directly and personally. Into this relationship are woven the stories, songs and activities that form the fabric of Australian children's culture.

our School is successful because it satisfies our basic human need to interact with other people and to be valued by them.

our School aims to extend the child's interest and it encourages participation.

Each program contains a story, some songs (both traditional and new) and a variety of play ideas with things to make and do.
Each week has a theme which is developed in different ways depending on the day. The daily format usually includes the Clock and a look outside Play School via the Windows. </p>
